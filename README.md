# Coso Player

This will become a winamp like player, it will take time though

## Running

You need a winamp skin, for now extract it under `./skins/tmp` It is not part of this repo for obvious reasons.

then you can just `go run ./main.go ./actions.go`

This is very much ongoing as it is a thing i began during Golab IO (amazing conference in firenze, check it out)
as a proof of concept.

The code is a big hack and changes are ongoing as i learn fyne.

## Collaborating

If you feel like, so this will take less than a decade, feel free to map sprites in `sprites.json` file
